The BBC Radio 5 Live broadcaster was accused of mocking the Duchess of Sussex''s African-American heritage, with Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, who was born on Monday and will be seventh in line to the throne, becoming the first bi-racial British-American royal. Following widespread criticism, Baker again took to Twitter in a bid to quell the controversy, apologising for the "gag" post. "Sincere apologies for the stupid unthinking gag pic earlier," he wrote. "Royal watching not my forte." Hours later, the 61-year-old confirmed he had been fired from BBC Radio 5 Live, in a call he described as "a masterclass of pompous faux-gravity". "[The call] took a tone that said I actually meant that ridiculous tweet and the BBC must uphold blah blah blah," he tweeted. "Literally threw me under the bus. Could hear the suits'' knees knocking." In a statement to BBC News, a spokesperson for the corporation said Baker''s tweet was "a serious error of judgement" that goes against "the values we as a station aim to embody". "Danny''s a brilliant broadcaster but will no longer be presenting a weekly show with us," they added.
